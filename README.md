Performance and Accessibility both improved to 100; Best Practices and SEO were already strong and stayed the same.

## Design Notes

Notely is a single `App` component with child components (`NoteInput`, `NoteList`, `NoteCard`) for simplicity. State managed via React hooks with automatic localStorage persistence.

**Data Model:** Notes use timestamp-based IDs, contain 5-300 character text, and have `pending` or `approved` status.

**Key Decisions:**
- Timestamp IDs for simplicity and uniqueness
- Separate CSS file for maintainability
- Real-time validation with character counter
- Filtering by status (all/pending/approved)
- Markdown support for rich text formatting in notes

**Tech Stack:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, localStorage, marked (markdown parser)

### Things to implement for the future:

- QA engineering measure: test Notely against [😈 The Big List of Naughty Strings](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings)
- Filter by status (pending/approved/all)
- Search functionality
- Note categories/tags
